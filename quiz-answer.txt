Code 1 should be more efficient because it uses a technique called 'event delegation'. This way, React doesn't have to create too much event listeners. With event bubbling, we can centrally handle those events at the parent element.

On the other hand,, Code 2 might be more intuitive and straightforward. So the better way depends on the coding convention of the team.
